  <p> 
    Fancyplants is the result of a girl having way too many houseplants. I find collecting and caring for plants therapeutic and calming, so my room is full of them. However, I started finding the limited options at garden centres, and my overflowing shelves of propagating plants to be an issue. An issue solved by Fancyplants! 

    I created this platform to unite plant lovers around the world to share the love of houseplants, and the diverse varieties we have accumulated. You can buy, sell and exchange houseplants from peer-to-peer, avoiding inflated greenhouse costs and gaining new varieties youâ€™ve never seen, sharing the joy of plants and their healing properties. Everyone is welcome in the knowledgable, kind and fun Fancyplants community, from plant newbies to seasoned houseplant aficionados. Happy planting!
